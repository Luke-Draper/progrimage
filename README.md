# Progrimage

This is an SVG Image editor that is designed to take a jpeg or png image, find its focus points, and then place vertices at those points to quickly create low-poly stylized art.

## How to Use

Click on the central canvas to create a point.

Holding 'shift' lets you select multiple points at once

Pressing 'l' creates lines between all selected points

Selecting the points on either end of a line selects the line

Pressing 'f' creates faces between selected lines

Faces can only have three points

Pressing 'backspace' deletes selected points, lines, and faces

The top bar contains undo, redo, visibility toggle, and zoom buttons

You can also zoom and pan using the mouse wheel and right click

The right side has tabs to edit the background, layers, points, lines, and faces

You can upload a background image

All points, lines, and faces will draw with the background image color when placed unless the checkbox is unchecked

The button to the left of the checkbox will place the number of points listed on the right onto the canvas based on the image

To use the program I would upload an image, have it place points onto the image for me, switch to the layer with all those points, select all with ctrl+a and then hit 'l' and 'f' to make a low poly version of the image.
